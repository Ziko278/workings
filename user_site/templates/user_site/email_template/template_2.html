            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We hope you’re doing well.
</p>
            <p>This is a follow-up regarding your recent confirmation and the ongoing withdrawal process. We’re pleased to inform you that the preparation of licence documents for all customers has been completed. Your document is currently being finalized and will be sent to you within the week.
</p>
            <p>In addition, your exact payment date will be communicated once the final verification is complete. We’ve also confirmed your request for a full withdrawal of your main balance of $57,200, which will be processed accordingly once your licence document has been fully validated.
</p>
            <p>Please note that any final validation requirements will be shared with you as soon as your withdrawal is ready for processing. While our response times may occasionally be slower due to the high volume of ongoing verifications, rest assured that all customer requests are being reviewed and completed in order.
</p>
            <p>We sincerely appreciate your patience, understanding, and continued trust as we work to finalize your disbursement smoothly.
</p>
