            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We’re reaching out with an important update regarding your withdrawal process.</p>
            <p>We’re pleased to inform you that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved
                your withdrawal application,
                confirming that you have successfully fulfilled all company and regulatory requirements.
            </p>
            <p>However, there is one final action required on your end. FINRA has rejected the initial
                withdrawal method you submitted, as their policy mandates that all disbursements involving
                amounts such as yours must be made directly to a verified bank account. As such, your
                previously selected withdrawal method could not be accepted.
</p>
            <p>To proceed, we kindly ask that you resubmit your withdrawal destination details using a valid bank account. This is the only outstanding requirement from FINRA at this time.
</p>
            <p>Please note that we are still awaiting final approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is currently under review. We will notify you as soon as we receive a response from them.
</p>
            <p>
Once we receive your updated account information and CFTC approval is granted, your withdrawal can be finalized without further delay.
</p>
            <p>
Thank you once again for your cooperation and understanding.
