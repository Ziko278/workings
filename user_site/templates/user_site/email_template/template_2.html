            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>
Thank you for your message, and we sincerely understand your concern. We truly apologize for the repeated inconvenience this may have caused and fully acknowledge the effort you have already made in completing previous payments.
</p>
            <p>
Please rest assured that this final levy is the last and only remaining step required to finalize your disbursement process. Once this is completed, there will be no further fees or requirements from your end. This adjustment was introduced solely to ensure a smooth, transparent, and fully compliant withdrawal process for all clients.
</p>
            <p>We genuinely appreciate your patience and commitment throughout this process, and we encourage you to kindly complete this last step at your earliest convenience. Making the payment early will be highly beneficial, as it ensures your disbursement is processed promptly within the official withdrawal window (Thursday, 23rd October â€“ Tuesday, 28th October 2025), without any delay or queue-related hold-ups.

</p>
            <p>Once your payment is confirmed, we will immediately issue your exact disbursement date</p>
            <p>
We sincerely value your trust and cooperation, Imani, and we assure you that this is the final requirement before the release of your funds.
</p>
