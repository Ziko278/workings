            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding throughout this process, and we sincerely regret the delays and extra hurdles you’ve had to experience. Your trust means a lot to us, and we are committed to ensuring your withdrawal is completed as smoothly as possible.
</p>
            <p>As part of the final stage, there is a one-time top-up of $215 required to complete your license document creation. This is not a standard charge but rather the result of unexpected procedures that arose during compliance checks. Once this step is completed, your document will be finalized and you will be cleared for withdrawal.
</p>
            <p>Please rest assured that your account remains in good standing with a current balance of $57,200, and your place in the withdrawal queue is fully secured for the upcoming window of Wednesday, October 8 – Friday, October 10, 2025.
</p>
            <p>We understand how inconvenient this may feel, and we want to assure you that this is the final step before everything is concluded. Our team will continue to support you closely until the process is completed.

</p>
            <p>Thank you once again for your trust and patience—we deeply value working with you.
</p>
