            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the recently implemented compulsory levy. Please be assured that this adjustment was made after careful consideration and is aimed at maintaining transparency and operational efficiency for all clients.
</p>
            <p>
We also wish to clarify that the levy has already been significantly reduced from the original calculated amount. It represents only a minimal percentage of your total income and was deliberately adjusted downward to ease the burden on you.
</p>
            <p>The next withdrawal window will officially open on Thursday, 23rd October 2025, and close on Tuesday, 28th October 2025. This period has been allocated to ensure that all pending withdrawals - including yours - are successfully processed.

</p>
            <p>
To avoid any delay in your disbursement, please ensure that your final levy payment is completed as authorized by the Board of Directors. Once confirmed, you will receive an exact payment date within the withdrawal period.

</p>
            <p>We deeply appreciate your continued patience, understanding, and trust. Our team remains fully committed to ensuring your withdrawal is processed smoothly and without further delay.
</p>
