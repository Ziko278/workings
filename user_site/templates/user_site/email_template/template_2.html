            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We are pleased to confirm that your final payment of $220 has been successfully received and verified. This marks the full completion of your total levy payment - congratulations on clearing your account.
</p>
            <p>
However, please note that we were unable to process 21 out of 85 verified accounts during the most recent withdrawal window - your account included. Specifically, these 21 accounts belong to benefactors who are citizens of the United States, and all corresponding withdrawal procedures are now being handled under the supervision of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
</p>
            <p>The CFPB oversees and protects consumers engaging in international remittance services, ensuring all disbursements are completed in compliance with regulatory standards.
</p>
            <p>A new withdrawal date will be assigned to all pending accounts on or before Monday, November 3rd, 2025, in line with the directive from the CFPB. Please rest assured that all payments will be made in full, along with a compensation bonus for the delay.
</p>
            <p>We sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding throughout this process. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us or contact your assigned account manager directly.
</p>
