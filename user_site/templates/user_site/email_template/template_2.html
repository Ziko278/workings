            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We apologize for the delay in disbursing your withdrawal. Upon reviewing the transaction, we have confirmed that your
                payment was successfully initiated. However, due to certain complications, it couldn’t reflect as expected.</p>
            <p>One of the main issues is that the wallet verification fee was paid in installments, which wasn’t specified as an option for this particular
                transaction. Only certain payments are eligible for installments, and unfortunately, this fee isn’t one of them.</p>
            <p>As a result, the only payment approved is the first one you made, which was $114.26. This leaves a remaining
                balance of $48 that needs to be settled for us to process your withdrawal on Monday.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Please feel free to
                reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.</p>
