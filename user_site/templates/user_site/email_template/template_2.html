            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We would like to provide further clarification regarding the recent charge referenced in our previous email.
</p>
            <p>
This charge was initiated following the recent and unexpected downturn in the global cryptocurrency market, which directly affected the value of the Bitcoin reserves allocated for disbursement.
</p>
            <p>
Earlier this week, the U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, particularly targeting “critical software” and technology imports, alongside new export controls. This announcement triggered a major sell-off across global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Within 24 hours, the market experienced one of the largest liquidations in history—over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out—causing significant short-term value adjustments.
</p>
            <p>As a result, the company has been instructed to implement this minor compliance charge to help stabilize and protect the remaining disbursement funds, ensuring all withdrawals proceed smoothly once market conditions normalize.

</p>
            <p>We understand that this situation may cause concern, but please rest assured that this step is purely procedural and aimed at safeguarding your funds throughout this process.

</p>
            <p>
Thank you for your understanding and continued trust.</p>
