            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We hope this message finds you well.</p>

<p>This email serves as a very important and urgent follow-up regarding your payment status, license documentation, and an updated directive from the processing agency.</p>

<p>First, we are pleased to confirm that your license document is ready and will be forwarded to you via email instead of sending a physical document.</p>

<p>However, we are writing to formally inform you of a new policy update from the agency overseeing withdrawals. Due to the high volume of withdrawal requests being processed daily, the agency has placed a minimum withdrawal threshold of $20,000 for all clients currently awaiting withdrawal. As a result, certain high-value withdrawals will be deferred until January next year.</p>

<p>Please note that this decision is entirely beyond our control and not an intentional delay or withholding of funds by our company.</p>

<p>To address this situation and protect affected clients, the company is offering a temporary insurance compensation plan. Under this arrangement:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clients whose withdrawals are deferred will receive an additional 20% bonus added to their withdrawal amount.</li>
    <li>This insurance benefit is only applicable if you agree to and accept a complete payment plan scheduled for next month.</li>
    <li>This offer is time-sensitive and available strictly under the stated terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our team remains committed to ensuring a smooth and fair resolution for all clients.</p>

<p>Should you require any clarification or wish to proceed with the insurance payment plan, please contact us immediately so we can guide you through the next steps.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience, understanding, and continued cooperation.</p>
