            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>Thank you for reaching out. We’ve received your recent complaint and
                have carefully reviewed your withdrawal request once again.</p>
            <p>After a detailed review, we’d like to inform you that your withdrawal process has already been made as flexible as possible in your favor. Recently, transaction costs have significantly increased, and based on the percentage typically calculated from the withdrawal amount and transaction charges, your total fee would amount to over $1,500.
</p>
            <p>However, due to your consistency in following up with your funds and the fact that you’ve previously gone through this process, a considerable concession has been made for you. As a result, your charge has been reduced to a token sum of $339.
</p>
            <p>Please note that all outstanding charges must be cleared on or before your assigned disbursement date to avoid any delays or forfeiture of your current payment slot.
</p>
            <p>
We appreciate your understanding and continued cooperation. If you have any further questions or require support, feel free to reach out.
</p>
