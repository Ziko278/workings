            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>

            <p>We are writing to confirm that a payment has been received toward your final levy for the ongoing CFPB registration and withdrawal process. However, please be informed that we were unable to process your withdrawal - as the payment received was incomplete, and as such, your registration and disbursement cannot be processed at this time.
</p>
            <p>Additionally, the remaining required registration documents and details have not yet been submitted. To complete your file and proceed with clearance, you are required to remit an additional fee of $145. This covers both the late entry charge and the outstanding amount on your levy.
</p>
            <p>
Kindly ensure that this payment, along with your pending documentation, is submitted promptly to avoid further delay in processing your final disbursement.
</p>
            <p>
Should you need any clarification or assistance completing this stage, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Our team remains available to guide you through the process.
</p>
