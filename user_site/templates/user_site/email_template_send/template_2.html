            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We hope you are doing well. This message is to acknowledge receipt of your recent part-payment for the $1,000 fee required before withdrawal. We can confirm that the amount received on our end is $844. This difference appears to be due to a drop in the crypto asset’s value while your transaction was delayed in transit. Such delays often occur as a result of network congestion or temporary processing issues.
</p>
            <p>At this time, your payment is not yet complete, and the transaction cannot be confirmed. To finalize your payment, an outstanding balance of $201 is required. This amount is slightly higher than the initial remainder due to ongoing market volatility, which we aim to mitigate to prevent further discrepancies or delays.
</p>
            <p>
Once the full payment reflects on our system, we will immediately verify it and proceed to the next stage of your withdrawal. After successful confirmation, your disbursement document will be issued, and a specific withdrawal date will be assigned. Disbursement will then follow without delay.
</p>
            <p>Please be reminded that, as previously stated, 41.17% of the total amount becomes payable only after your withdrawal has been received. All other procedures remain active and unchanged.
</p>
            <p>To avoid additional processing delays, kindly ensure all outstanding fees are settled promptly. This will enable us to complete your verification and disbursement smoothly.
</p>
            <p>Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
</p>
