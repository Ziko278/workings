            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>This is a follow-up regarding your approved withdrawal of $57,200, scheduled for release during the current window.
</p>
            <p>Please note that, in order to validate your payment for Friday, September 12th, a final agreement/entry fee of $587 is required. This is necessary because your initial slot was lost previously, and this step ensures your account is cleared for disbursement.
</p>
            <p>
We kindly request that the fee be settled by Thursday, September 11 (or latest, the morning of Friday, September 12). Once completed, your withdrawal will be processed without delay, and you will receive your funds as stipulated. If the payment is not cleared within this timeframe, your withdrawal may need to be postponed to the next cycle.
</p>
            <p>We sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding, and we assure you that once this final step is completed, nothing will prevent your payment on Friday.
</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or require assistance with the process, please do not hesitate to contact us.
</p>
