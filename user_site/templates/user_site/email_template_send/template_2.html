            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
           <p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the missed payment date and the delay in our response. We understand how important this process is to you and truly appreciate your continued patience.

</p>
           <p>The company is currently undergoing an internal audit and evaluation of all financial transactions to ensure accuracy and transparency. As a result, withdrawal dates for all customers have been rescheduled to next week.
</p>
           <p>Weâ€™ve reviewed your record and confirmed that you have completed your previous charges promptly, ahead of most customers - we appreciate your cooperation.
</p>
           <p>However, there will be one final payment required to facilitate the release of your licence document, which is a necessary compliance step designed to ensure the security of your funds and verify all customer accounts.
</p>
           <p>Kindly note that this is not an additional or hidden fee. All major charges have already been completed, but the company has been instructed to ensure every client finalizes this token payment before their licence and withdrawal can be released. This step helps the company recover part of the costs incurred in securing the document process for all customers.
</p>
           <p>We remain committed to ensuring your withdrawal is completed smoothly and without further delay. Thank you once again for your patience, understanding, and trust in this process.
</p>

                Best regards,<br>
