            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We sincerely apologize for not meeting the originally scheduled date for your withdrawal, and we understand how important this payment is to you.
</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, your transaction was affected by a delay currently linked to a preventive security review triggered by recent irregularities on our network. As part of our compliance and protection protocols, anytime there’s a suspected breach or abnormal transaction pattern, the system initiates an automatic hold for further investigation.
</p>
            <p>
This is a standard precautionary measure to protect both our clients and the company’s financial infrastructure. While no client data or funds have been compromised, the system must complete a full security audit before releasing flagged disbursements.
</p>
            <p>Please rest assured that your funds are safe and intact, and our team is actively working to finalize the necessary checks. We are giving this matter top priority, and we expect to have full resolution within the next working cycle. An updated withdrawal list will be made and your new date will be communicated to you.
</p>
            <p>Once again, we truly regret the inconvenience this delay has caused and appreciate your continued patience and understanding. If you have any questions or would like to speak directly with a support member, please feel free to reply to this email or contact us at any time.
