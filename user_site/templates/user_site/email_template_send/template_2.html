            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We hope this message finds you well.</p>
            <p>Weâ€™re writing to inform you that you are still currently on the waiting list for withdrawal,
                and only a
                few final confirmation steps remain before your payment of $54,087 can be processed.</p>
            <p>At the moment, the final fee you recently paid to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has
                not yet reflected on your dashboard. This is a standard delay and should be resolved shortly.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, we are awaiting final approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),
                which is currently conducting a routine review of your profile. This review is part of their
                compliance process to ensure that all client records meet regulatory standards before any
                disbursements are made.</p>
            <p>We anticipate that everything will be fully wrapped up within the next week, but kindly ask
                that you await further updates from our team. We will notify you as soon as there are any
                changes or once your withdrawal has been approved.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your continued patience and understanding.</p>
            <p>
                Best regards,<br>
                TRA Disbursement Team
