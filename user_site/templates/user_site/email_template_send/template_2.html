            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>Thank you for reaching out and expressing your concern regarding the recently communicated levy.</p>
            <p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this situation may have caused. Please rest assured that your complaint has been received and acknowledged. We understand how upsetting this must be, especially as it was not previously anticipated. We take full responsibility for the oversight,
                and we are committed to ensuring such lapses do not happen again.</p>
            <p>However, we would like to kindly clarify that the 1.5% levy was not applied arbitrarily. It is a compulsory policy directive issued from our administrative head office, affecting all older accounts currently undergoing withdrawal validation. Unfortunately, your account falls within this category.
</p>
            <p>While we regret that you are affected by this policy, we want to emphasize that the levy is strictly for compliance and processing purposes. Once settled, your withdrawal will be processed promptly within 12 hours, with no further delay.
</p>
            <p>We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we remain available should you need any assistance or further clarification.
</p>
