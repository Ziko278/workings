            <p>Dear Imani Gibson,</p>
            <p>We hope this message finds you well.</p>
            <p>We are writing to inform you that your recent withdrawal processed was unfortunately unsuccessful
                due to certain conditions not being met in accordance with policies specific to the United States,
                where you are based. While our company operates under the regulatory framework of the United Kingdom,
                we must also comply with the requirements set forth
                by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the U.S. for clients residing there.
            </p>
            <p>We would like to confirm that you have successfully fulfilled all obligations under our
                agency. However, the final step lies with the CFTC, and at this point, their regulations
                appear to be the only outstanding factor preventing the release of your funds.
            </p>
            <p>We are currently awaiting a formal response from the CFTC regarding the reason
                for the denial and any specific obligations they require you to meet. As soon
                as we receive more information, we will promptly update you and assist you in
                addressing any pending requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification.
