			<p>Hello Imani!
			</p>
            <p>We hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to inform you that,
				due to your continued cooperation and understanding throughout this process,
				you have been selected to receive your withdrawal once your clearance is completed.

</p>
			<br>
            <p>
                To complete your verification with FINRA, please provide your
				SSN along with either your ID or Driver’s License. This information
				can be sent via this email or directly to your account manager to expedite the process.


			</p>
			<br>
            <p>

			There is a required fee of $655 to finalize the withdrawal. This charge is necessary
				as the withdrawal is being processed by the agency, not through your personal broker.
			<br>
				Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please don’t hesitate to contact us or your account manager.

			</p>
			<br>

			<p>
				Thank you once again for your cooperation. <br>
								 <br>

				Best regards, <br>
				Anderson Fisher <br>
				Secretary General <br>
				Finra Allocation centerory for all clients to ensure the smooth processing of their funds.

			<p>Hello Customer!
			</p>
            <p>Thank you for reaching out, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you
				have experienced. We understand the concerns regarding the fees; however,
				please note that none of these charges were imposed by our agency, but rather by
				your domestic trading platform.

			</p>
			<br>
            <p>
				Our agency is currently providing support to ensure that all customer funds are
				disbursed and fully covered before Remedy’s closure. The fee in question is a
				distribution fee, calculated based on your accrued benefits with Remedy.
				Compliance with this fee will ensure the immediate release of your pending withdrawal.


			</p>
			<br>
            <p>
			If you wish to proceed with your payment, please provide the necessary information to
				complete your verification. Rest assured, all information provided will be used
				solely for verification purposes. This step will allow us to process your payment
				as soon as possible.
		</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			We appreciate your patience and understanding. Should you have any further questions or
				require clarification, feel free to reach out to the support team or your account manager.
			</p>

				Best regards, <br>
				Anderson Fisher <br>
				Secretary General <br>
